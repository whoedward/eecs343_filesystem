###### Lab 4: Filesystems ###################
#############################################

Here are the functions we implemented for this lab followed by a short description of what they do:

get_super_block(void* fs): return a pointer to the primary super block of a file system.

get_block_size(void* fs): return the block size of a filesystem from its super block.

get_block(void* fs, __u32 block_num): return a pointer to a block, given its number. Simply offset the fs pointer by the block size multiplied by the block number.

get_block_group(void* fs, __u32 block_group_num): Return a pointer to the first block group descriptor in a filesystem.

get_inode(void* fs, __u32 inode_num): return a pointer to an inode given its number.

get_root_dir(void* fs): get the inode of the root directory.

get_inode_from_dir(void* fs, struct ext2_inode* dir, char* name): given the inode for a directory and a filename, return the inode number of that file inside that directory, or 0 if the file doesn't exist in that directory. 

get_inode_by_path(void* fs, char* path): find the inode number for a file by its full path.
